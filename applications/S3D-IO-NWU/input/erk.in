Notes About Settings
--------------------
 1. EKR scheme should be set to -64.
 2. Initial timestep should be set 10 to 100 smaller than the anticipated CFL limit.
 3. Minimum timestep should be used with CAUTION! It should be set at least 100 times
    less than the anticipated CFL limit.
 4. Relative Runge-Kutta error tolerance should be set between 1.0e-3 and 1.0e-4.
 5. Absolute Runge-Kutta error tolerance should be set between 1.0e-12 and 1.0e-14.
    Keep this value very small, near machine precision!
 6. Controller saftey factor should be set between 0.8 and 0.9.
 7. Controller gains should always be set to 0.2, 0.2, 0.05, and 0.0, respectively.
 8. Overall maximum change in timestep should be set between 3.0 and 5.0.
