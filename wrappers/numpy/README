ADIOS Python/Numpy wrapper
-----------------

This directory contains the codes for the ADIOS Python/Numpy wrapper
to call the native ADIOS library. This module is built by Cython.

This module requires ADIOS built with the GNU C compiler with
relocatable codes. Add -fPIC flag to CFLAGS before configuring ADIOS.

== Quick install with pip ==

ADIOS Python wrapper can be installed with pip. Check if pip is
installed already. Otherwise, install pip first:

$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ sudo python get-pip.py
Or,
$ python get-pip.py --user
to install in a local directory, $HOME/.local

Before installing ADIOS Python wrappers, make sure Numpy and MPI4Py
installed. Otherwise, install them as follows:

$ pip install numpy
$ pip install mpi4py

Then, install Adios and Adios-MPI wrapper as follows:

$ pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi adios
$ pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi adios_mpi

== Build and install with make ==

A Makefile is included for building. The following commands will
display instructions on how to build and install python wrappers for
Adios.

$ make
$ make install

Have 'adios_config' and 'python' in the path and run

$ make python

If you need a MPI-enabled ADIOS wrapper, which requires MPI4Py, type
the following:

$ make MPI=y python

After successful building, you can install in a python path. There are
three options

$ python setup.py install

which will install python's default installation location. This may
require an admin privilege.

You may want to use a custom directory to install. Type

$ python setup.py install --prefix=/dir/to/install

and append the directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable

You can also install in your local directory, run

$ python setup.py install --user


== Test cases and examples ==

Test cases and example files are located in tests and example
directory.


== Compile with Cython (only for developers) ==

The C++ code (adios.cpp and adios_mpi.cpp) has been already generated
by with Cython (version 0.20.1) and included here. Just in case to
reproduce the C++ code, try the following command. Otherwise, one can
skip this part.

$ make CYTHON=y python

for the serial version of Adios wrapper. If you need to generated C++
for MPI-enabled version, try the following

$ make CYTHON=y MPI=y python


== Upload to PyPI ==

Create $HOME/.pypirc as follows:
[distutils] 
    index-servers =
        pypi

[pypi]
    repository: https://pypi.python.org/pypi
    username: {{your_username}}
    password: {{your_password}}

Then, do the followings:
$ python setup.py register 
$ python setup.py sdist upload

== Trouble Shooting ==

-. Custom MPICC and MPICXX
If one needs to use a custom MPICC and MPICXX command (e.g., Titan),
then use the following command:

$ python setup_mpi.py build_ext --mpicc=cc --mpicxx=CC
